You MUST ONLY suggest questions about the CURRENT product they are viewing:
Product Name: {{{productName}}}
Product Description: {{{productDescription}}}

User's question: {{{productQuestion}}}
{{#previousQuestions}}
Previously asked questions (DO NOT repeat these): {{{previousQuestions}}}
{{/previousQuestions}}
{{#questionContext}}
Question context: {{{questionContext}}}
{{/questionContext}}

IMPORTANT: 
- Generate 3 DIFFERENT follow-up questions that are SPECIFICALLY about "{{{productName}}}"
- DO NOT suggest questions about other products
- DO NOT repeat any previously asked questions
- Focus on the actual product the user is looking at
- Questions should be related to the product's specific features, uses, or characteristics
- Vary the question types (usage, specifications, comparisons, etc.)
- Make questions natural and conversational

For example, if the product is "Basmati Rice Premium Grade", suggest questions about rice cooking, storage, recipes, etc.
If the product is "Running Shoes", suggest questions about running, fit, performance, etc.

Provide exactly 3 relevant, varied follow-up questions about {{{productName}}}.`,
